# Project 4 - Movie Recommender

For our fourth project at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, we were tasked with using Natural Language Processing

I used data from the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) on Kaggle to create a recommendation engine which would recommend movies which are similar to a chosen movie based on the movie's description, cast, director, writer, and genre. I then created a Flask app with my recommender and deployed it with Heroku.
