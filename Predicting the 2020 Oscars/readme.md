# Project 3 - Predicting the 2020 Oscars

For our third project at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a Classification Model using Supervised Learning Techniques.

I used data from four datasets found on Kaggle as well as scraped data from Wikipedia and utilized Logistic Regression, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, and other modeling techniques to predict the winners at the 92nd Academy Awards.

Datasets used:
* [The Oscar Award, 1927-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/the-oscar-award) (Dataset only went up to 2019 when acquired)
* [Golden Globe Awards, 1944-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/golden-globe-awards)
* [Rotten Tomatoes - Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critics-datasets)
* [Metacritic Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/miazhx/metacritic-movie-reviews)
