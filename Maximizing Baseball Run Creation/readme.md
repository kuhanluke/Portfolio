#Project 2 - Maximizing Baseball Run Creation

For our second project at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a Linear Regression model to make a prediction based on existing data.

With free reign in our topic selection, I chose something I’m already passionate and knowledgeable about: baseball. My initial idea was to find how college stats would translate to major league performance, however, when scraping data, I discovered that there wasn’t enough publicly available college data to build a model, so I decided instead to shift gears and leverage the much more robust dataset of MLB players’ batted ball profiles to compare them to their wRC+ and build a predictive model on that. I pulled data from FanGraphs and Statcast to explore the relationship between players' batted ball data and their wRC+.
